# Assignment for FE adepts

In case of questions feel free to reach me out on [jirka@meiro.io](mailto:jirka@meiro.io)

Your task will be to create a SPA using React and other libraries of your choice. We prepared API endpoints for you and UI design in Figma ([link](https://www.figma.com/file/T923VtGAxtxaXHOjZ98gF4/CDP-dev?node-id=0%3A1)). As you can see, the app consists of two pages (use React router):

- Customers list with search functionality
- Customer detail

## What we'll be evaluating?

We'll focus on:

- User experience
- Clean and well-structured code with reusable components
- Solution without bugs and covered by quality tests

We don't want you to make responsive version, **only desktop**.

### Unit tests

We ask you to create unit tests for `Search` component on `Customer search`Â page and for `Group of events` on `Customer detail` page. **We don't want you to cover the whole solution by tests!**

## Assignment instructions

There's `assets` folder which includes source icons and customer avatars. Other icons you can see in figma is obtainable from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Customers list

This will be the main screen of the application. When you first reach it, there will be only upper bar with `Customers search` title and search bar. Once you make some search (**even empty search is allowed to list all customers**), the table will be populated by results. Feel free to adjust column names by what you get in response, the design is not 1:1 precise. We don't want any kind of sorting functionality etc.

You can click on the customer to view his detail or you can additionally load more customers.

### Customer detail

Here you can find additional information about your customers, especially the timeline of their events. At the top of the page, there's `back button` followed by header bar which contains customer name and a list of sources. The greyed sources are these ones where the customer doesn't have any event.

Finally, there's a timeline of events, which will be by default collapsed (if there're any expandable parts for some customer). It has `day` resolution, which means you have to group multiple events into expandable parts of the page and these events are hidden by default. You can toggle the groups by clicking on the `arrow` button on the right side. If there's only one event on a particular day, it's shown by default.

## API reference

API server can be started by `yarn start` or `npm start` command, at first you need to do `yarn install` or `npm install` of course.

### GET /customers
